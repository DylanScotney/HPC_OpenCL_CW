# High Performance Computing Two Stage Project
This repo contains two simple python notebooks used for my HPC module
that was part of my Scientific Computing MSc at UCL. 

We solved the time dependent and time independent poisson equation using
using an OpenCL kernel to implement a parallelised FDM method. 

Stage 2 report is a continutation of stage 1 such that reading stage 1
is a prerequisite for stage 2. Both require some previous knowledge of 
FDM and the poisson equation.
